            <p>At PNK Advocates, Tax laws are among the most dynamic pieces of legislation because they are amended almost every year to serve various economic and social goals of the government. This necessitates that the laws are regularly updated with the various amendments for ease of reference. This compendium contains an up-to-date reproduction of the Income Tax Act, Cap 340, the Value Added Tax Act, Cap 349, the Excise Duty Act 2014, and the Tax Procedure Code Act, 2014. It also includes subsidiary legislation and practice notes under different the tax laws. In updating this version, the "Reprint of the Income Tax Act and the Value Added Tax Act as at 19th October 2012", by the Uganda Law Reform Commission was used as an authentic reference for conformity; and all the amendments to the principal Acts and Regulations have been incorporated to date.
