            <h5 class="text-pink font-weight-bold">Intellectual property advice</h5>
                <p class="ml-3">Our IP teams offer a breadth of experience in IP transactional and advisory work, covering the full range of IP subjects, in both domestic and international contexts.</p>
            <p class="text-pink font-weight-bold">Examples of our work include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patent, trademark and copyright litigation</li>
                <li>Technology licenses and joint ventures and other forms of technical cooperation and development </li>
                <li>Brand licensing, sponsorship and franchising agreements </li>
                <li>Copyright-based agreements across the creative industries with a particularly strong experience and focus on digital and online aspects </li>
                <li>Analysis of IP portfolios and IP-related agreements in M&A and financing projects, inputting into transaction documents and preparing associated agreements and recorders </li>
                <li>IP risk assessment on proposed new ventures and advice on risk minimization </li>
                <li>Advice on best practice use and protection of IP </li>
                <li>Patent licensing and cross-licensing</li>
                <li>Unfair competition</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Like our IP disputes lawyers, most of our transactional and advisory IP lawyers focus on specific sectors and bring both pure and applied legal knowledge to client projects.</p>
            <h5 class="text-pink font-weight-bold">Intellectual property disputes and enforcement</h5>
            <ul>
                <p>Our IP lawyers have extensive experience of strategizing, pursuing and defending IP disputes in a wide range of forums, including:</p>
                <li>National and regional courts for disputes about misappropriation, infringement, validity, ownership and rights of use of all forms of IP rights</li>
                <li>National and regional patent and trademark offices for disputes about registered IP rights</li>
                <li>Customs and national law enforcement and regulatory authorities for counterfeiting and infringement cases and border seizures</li>
                <li>Bespoke dispute resolution procedures (e.g. for domain name disputes).</li>
                <li>Arbitrations with IP subject matter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our IP lawyers are used to dealing with technical and specialist subject matter, and many of them focus on specific sectors, giving them a more applied knowledge of how IP is exploited in practice. They frequently work with colleagues and external local lawyers in other jurisdictions to ensure claims are pursued consistently and in the most appropriate forums.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>They will pursue and defend cases aggressively and effectively but are able to resolve a high percentage of disputes by negotiated settlements.</p>
